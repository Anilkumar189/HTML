        <p><dd>Ranvijay "Vijay" Singh is the son of Balbir Singh, a powerful Delhi-based businessman. Despite Balbir being a strict father, Vijay's love for his father is deep and abiding. Balbir doesn't know about his son's devotion for him due to his busy schedule, which also keeps him from spending time with his family.

            One day, Balbir sent Vijay to a boarding school in the USA when Vijay threatens the bullies of his elder sister Reet with an AK-47. Vijay finishes his education and returns home after several years.

Vijay marries his childhood girlfriend Geetanjali and the couple cuts ties with their families and moves to the USA.
            
            Eight years later, Vijay, Geetanjali and their two kids return to India upon learning that Balbir had an assassination attempt.

Vijay starts an extramartial affair with Zoya, who eventually reveals that she was sent by Asrar's brother Abrar Haque to honey trap him, but Vijay had already knew this and played along to learn the mastermind's identity.
            
            Vijay learns from his grandfather Rajdheer Singh that Abrar and his brothers are Vijay's second cousins. They are the grandchildren of Shamsher Singh, Rajdheer's younger brother. Rajdheer had renounced Shamsher for his immoral antics. Shamsher's son Azim, who had converted to Islam, was denied any share in Balbir's assets, w</dd></p>
